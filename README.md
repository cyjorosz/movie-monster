State is managed using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Further Improvement Ideas

- Migrate to TypeScript
- Make the styles more modular
- Preserve the search state when moving from show back to index
- Make use of more endpoints to show more information about the shows (e.g. cast and episode list)
